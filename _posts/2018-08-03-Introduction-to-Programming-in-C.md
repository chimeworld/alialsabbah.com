I started a Coursera specialization called “Introduction to Programming in C”.

[Introductory C Programming Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/c-programming)

I felt like I’ve learned enough Python to be ready to take the training wheels off. I’ve already completed Week 1 and most of Week 2 at this point. This course is supposedly for those with little or no programming experience, but there has been no hand-holding. I’ve done just fine, but I might’ve struggled if I had no experience coming into it. Aside from that, I’d say that it’s a very well-made course. It is not designed to teach the syntax of a language, but to actually teach programming.
