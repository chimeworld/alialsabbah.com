Today, I started the UC Berkeley [CS 61](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhMnuBfGeCDNgVzLPxF9o5UNKG1b-LFY9) lecture series based on the legendary [*Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*](https://amzn.to/2w26fu1) book. There is also an excellent HTML/EPUB3 version of the book available [here](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/).

I am hoping to strengthen my knowledge of programming fundamentals by completing this set of lectures. This book has been highly recommended online. It is also supposed to be challenging and I am looking forward to a challenge.
